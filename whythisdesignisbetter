i can reuse the glfw app without the editor
this is done by amking the application and the editorUI friends. So they modify eachothers states directly, but they are still contained in different modules.

SO the Editor is like a layer on top of the application, that can modify its state.

now i just need to plug those modules rom engine14 in here. it should be a brief operation, since those modules are self contained.

some cleaning, of course.
ill cerate an asset store just like before, for storing state related to the 3d world.

i believe we can actually load a model as a scene
