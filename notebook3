there is animation data, and there is bone data which belongs to the mesh.
there are a bunch of animations, in the animation arrays.
an animation is made up of channels, each channel should correspond to a bone in one of the meshes. they should have the same name. 
the channels contain key data, in that struct.

There is definitely a problem with the way mixamo loads things, not with asimp and not with us. in fact assimp tries to do things correctly.
clearly there are less channels than bones.
we wil have to do some processing on the mixamo models.

we can move on to ther things.

yep, just as  i guessed, the animation exported from mixamo used some convention that is not understood by asimp fbx importer.
Importing into blender and reexporting fixes it. now there a channel for each bone in an animation. When it comes to assimp, missing bones should raise an error.
I also noticed a lot of matrices that did nothing when experimenting in the shader.
they were probably empty, or were not passed to the shader at all.
though this time we have more bones than channels, though, no missing bones.
also loading separate animations does not cause glitches.

mixamo is convenient, but it does come at a cost.
