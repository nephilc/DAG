there is animation data, and there is bone data which belongs to the mesh.
there are a bunch of animations, in the animation arrays.
an animation is made up of channels, each channel should correspond to a bone in one of the meshes. they should have the same name. 
the channels contain key data, in that struct.

There is definitely a problem with the way mixamo loads things, not with asimp and not with us. in fact assimp tries to do things correctly.
clearly there are less channels than bones.
we wil have to do some processing on the mixamo models.

we can move on to ther things.
