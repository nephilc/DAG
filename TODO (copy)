make the load functions staic, that way i can still keep things recursive. 
or
create factory functions in each class, that creates uninitialized scene members. we made sure they pose no problem in rendering.
register them with the object class.
call them after reading the type line when loading a Node.
And voila.

For other kinds of object we go thrgough the asset manager to avoid duplication.
so the factory would be a node factory for Now. 

Well, we do this because the parent doesnt know about its children, or any other objects.
