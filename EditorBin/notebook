the same model laoded without animation shows no problem(pumpkin hulk).
the same animation loaded in blender showws no problem, mixamo also shows no problem.
there is a string chance that there is an issue with the way we do animation.

Well, we can load all sorts of static models, of various sizes, no problem!
We just need PBR.
since we compute the matrices recursively, we can visualize them recursively.
###bug analisys
on the right hand: only the index seem to cause problems
on the left hand: al finger cause problems, except the index

the problem is present on other animations aswell, but i cant guess if it is exactly the same.
for the left index, the stretching seems to start after the middle joint. same thing for the right index.

for some animations, it loads, the animation starts to play, then i get int Bone::GetPositionIndex(float): Assertion `0' failed.;

//maybe there is some channel that messes things up;
