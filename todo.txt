simplify the default graph
edit position and scale of nodes see them, at least
determine the true scale of the models, why do they scale up

the problem with scaling is that modeling software use different units of measurements

Some use meters, others centimeters. This info is mentionned in the collada file for example, but it is ignored by assimp.
So maybe ishould use centimeters as well for saving geometry data, and convert to meters when drawing.
Blender doesnt seem to ignore the unit property of colladae, in fact changes in this property will affect how it is imported in blender.

In any case scaling down the model doesnt cause problems with the animation, it is something in the way we load it. this problem doesnt occur in blender.


we can move forward with animation blending.
