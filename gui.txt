alright so we will have a guiscreen object tobe rendered,
elements in te gui screen will have hitboxes
the gui will have access to the assetmanager to display and modify the state, switch between screens, switch between scenes

call render on the current gui after calling render on the current screen.

pretty much it will be immediate mode.

Logging Gui screen

gui elements will have bouding boxes for interaction

design mobile first.

large squares........

well there is usually three gui screens, or three, one for pause, one for in game, one for begining menu.
a  gui screen can cause a change in the current gui screen, or a change in the current scene.
keys, well one key like the escape key can cause that aswell, that is changing between in game and pause.
